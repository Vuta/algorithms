### Intro

I'm reading the book `Giai thuat va lap trinh` by `Le Minh Hoang`. (An excellent book about algorithms and data structure for Vietnamese students)

Algorithm is an important skill for programmers, but I do believe that it can be applied in not only programming, but also every other aspect of our daily life.

I hope that I will have a better thinking after finishing this book.

This repo contains all the coding practices in the book.
